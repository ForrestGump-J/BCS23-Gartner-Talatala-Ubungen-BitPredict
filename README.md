BitPredict: Digital Currency Insight Program

Objectives of the Project
The project BitPredict: Digital Currency Insight Program seeks to address/optimize the following:

1. Help users make sensible choices in cryptocurrency investments by using data trends to spotlight the best-performing cryptocurrencies.
2. Inform users on the possible value trajectory of a cryptocurrency and what actions to take accordingly.
3. Suggest possible cryptocurrency investment combinations to boost the portfolio value of users.
4. Educate users on market volatility and the potential risks of investing in cryptocurrency to encourage responsible investments among users.


Scope and Limitation of the Project
The project covers the following concepts in Discrete Structures 1, namely: graph theory (analyzing connections between different cryptocurrencies), combinatorics (possible investment combinations for a user portfolio), boolean algebra (for decision-making on predictions and classifying trends as upward, downward, or neutral), recurrence relations (for repeated calculations like the moving average of a cryptocurrency), functions (mapping input-output values to supply data for prediction), and set theory (grouping cryptocurrencies based on movement trends), but does not cover number theory, automata theory, advanced counting, proof techniques, advanced relations, complexity analysis, and discrete statistics.

Programming Language
The project will be made entirely in Python. Core libraries will be used to run the program, and it will use NetworkX and Matplotlib to create and manage crypto correlation graphs (nodes/edges). It will also use Numpy to calculate moving averages, percent changes, and other operations, as well as Itertools for portfolio combinations. Additionally, Pandas will be used for smooth data handling for all imports that will be used. Lastly, for live prices of coins, we will import a cryptocurrency API called CCXT or CryptoCurrency eXchange Trading instead of having sample prices.
